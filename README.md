logistic_reg_fastgrad
=====================

This code implements the fast gradient algorithm to solve the following logistic regression problem:

See the [examples](https://github.com/drjordy66/logistic_reg_fastgrad/tree/master/examples) section on how to use this algorithm on both a real-world dataset and a simulated dataset for classification problems.

All data will be downloaded during the example scripts. No outside downloads are required.

__PLEASE NOTE__: This algorithm does not implement cross-validation to find the optimal regularization parameter.
